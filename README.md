# Modified version of DN UnPSA Toolkit
'DN UnPSA Toolkit' is modified to have a Modeldef Generator button for GZDoom/Zandronum

All it does is use the program's built-in animation data array to access each animation's first and last frame, and based on that generate modeldef definitions for use with GZDoom or Zandronum.

You can specify the first 3 characters of a Sprite, the last character of the sprite will increase from A to Z and from Z to 0-9 everytime the alphabet for the frames have ran out.

It's also possible to skip every frame by 2.

This is a tool I used specially for Share the Doom (A Postal 2 GZDoom mod), but I figured there might be people out there that would enjoy this, as manually typing out the frames are tedious.

Because I'm not sure If I can share decompiled source code of the tool, I can only provide the executable.
